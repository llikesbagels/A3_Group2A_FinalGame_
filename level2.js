//   from Level 1: A/D move, SPACE jump, the periodic control-flip
//   with its countdown + flashing warning, and the sunrise/sunset
//   sky cycle. New this level: a set of stone platforms embedded
//   in a big waterfall cliff that you can jump up onto and climb.)
//
//  UPDATED: brings back Level 1's 3-heart HP system and its
//  ground obstacles (logs, rocks, rabbit/racoon). Hitting an
//  obstacle costs one heart, exactly like Level 1. Falling off
//  the waterfall platforms after you've climbed still kills you
//  immediately and restarts the level (unchanged) — but it now
//  also zeroes out all 3 hearts on the way down, since a fall
//  from that height is meant to cost you everything at once.
